work in progress for the implementation of a load balancer running nginx over HTTPS on a docker swarm;  
what works: i can run a nginx server over https and connect to it  
what needs to be done: modify the nginx.conf as seen in the lectures but in a way that works with https

This repository is not part of the bdp2_assignments repository to better synchronize autobuilds with dockerhub
